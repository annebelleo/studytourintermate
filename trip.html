				<h2>What is the study tour?</h2>
				<p>The study tour is a yearly trip organized by IS students for (IS) students. The trip lasts around three weeks and takes place during the summer holidays. During the study tour, the students get to know a country in terms of culture,
					companies and leisure. Participants will be introduced to interesting and historical places in the country, like monuments, museums and other sorts of sight-seeing places.
					<br>
					<br>
					Besides that, a range of innovative and inspiring companies will be visited during the trip. Companies will show their work environment, introduce interesting projects and sometimes even give small workshops or cases to learn more about
					what it is like working in at this company. Most of the visited businesses fall within the realm of the studies of our association, but it sometimes also happens that a company is interesting enough to not meet this requirement.
					<br>
					<br>
					Besides visiting businesses, it is also a tradition to visit the Dutch embassies in the visited countries. The embassy gives more insight into the relationship between the Netherlands and the visited country. This includes cooperation
					projects and information exchanges which enable the countries to learn from each other.
					<br>
					<br>
					During the trip, the group also does a lot of activities together, such as having drinks together, attend a show, and doing a â€˜scavenger huntâ€™-like game. Because there are at most 30 participants, the group usually gets close very soon. To
					encourage this, there is already a get-to-know evening before the trip, to make sure that everyone knows each other before they leave.
					<br>
					<br>
					As a token of remembrance, everyone gets a commemorative book at the end of the trip. Before, during, and after the trip, some people will make small articles on what we did on different days, the country itself, the group, and the cases.
					These are combined with pictures of the trip into an actual book(let).
				</p>

				<h2>What is required for someone to participate?</h2>
				<p>There are a few requirements that need to be taken into account, for anyone who wishes to join the study tour trip. Participants needs to have all the following requirements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A minimum requirement of 12 participants is needed.</li>
					<li>A student of Innovation Sciences (IS) is a collective name for the following:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Psychology & Technology </li>
						<li>Sustainable Innovation </li>
						<li>Innovation Sciences </li>
						<li>Human-Technology Interaction </li>
					</ul>
					<li>For bachelor students: </li>
					<ul>
						<li>The participant needs to at least be a 2nd year bachelor student.</li>
						<li>The participant needs to have completed 100 ECTS from an IS program. </li>
					</ul>
					<li>For all other students:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Pre-master students and first year master students need to have been a member of S.V Intermate since the 1st of October 2020.</li>
						<li>Master students, who did not obtain an IS bachelor, need to have been a member of S.V Intermate for at least 3 month prior to the 2020-2021 study year.</li>
						<li>Anyone who has partaken in a study tour of S.V. Intermate before, and anyone who has organized a study tour of S.V. Intermate before, are exempted from the requirements stated above. </li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<h2>What is a case study?</h2>
				If you want to participate in the studytour, it is mandatory to work on a case study. A case study is a hundred-hour project for a company that finances our studytour. We will link each student to a case study, taking into account the field
				of study and preferences. If we have fewer case studies than students, it may be that we can put two students on one case study. In this case, both students only have to work on the case study for fifty hours. But you should not only see this
				case study as a compulsory part that you have to invest a lot of time in. It is also a unique opportunity to collaborate with big companies and to develop your own skills. In addition, you will also receive guidance for carrying out this case
				study. You can always contact us as a committee, but every case study will also have a supervisor. A supervisor is someone from the university like a professor who knows a lot about the subject and they will guide you with working out the
				case study.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>When</h3>
				When the case study should be carried out depends on the wishes of the company. In any case, it will be in the period from January to July and you will have at least three months to conduct the case study.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Example</h3>
				To get a better understanding of what a case study would look like, here is an example. The project was of the company America Today. America Today keeps an annual inventory of the clothing in the stores. This is done manually and therefore
				administrative errors are not uncommon. An RFID chip can easily keep track of the status of each item of clothing, without having to scan every item manually. This way it can easily be tracked if a clothing item often enters the fitting rooms
				or is never bought at all. The question is whether the introduction of this technique is useful for America Today and what the costs would be on an annual basis. The company has further specified this in a number of questions answered by our
				students such as where should the RFID tags be attached to the item? The assignment consisted of several phases and those were: plan of action, start literature study, start research, discuss subtopics, conclusion, advice and presentation.
