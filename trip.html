				<h2>What is the study tour?</h2>
				<p>The study tour is a yearly trip organized by IS students for (IS) students. The trip lasts around three weeks and takes place during the summer holidays. During the study tour, the students get to know a country in terms of culture,
					companies and leisure. Participants will be introduced to interesting and historical places in the country, like monuments, museums and other sorts of sight-seeing places.
					<br>
					<br>
					Besides that, a range of innovative and inspiring companies will be visited during the trip. Companies will show their work environment, introduce interesting projects and sometimes even give small workshops or cases to learn more about
					what it is like working in at this company. Most of the visited businesses fall within the realm of the studies of our association, but it sometimes also happens that a company is interesting enough to not meet this requirement.
					<br>
					<br>
					Besides visiting businesses, it is also a tradition to visit the Dutch embassies in the visited countries. The embassy gives more insight into the relationship between the Netherlands and the visited country. This includes cooperation
					projects and information exchanges which enable the countries to learn from each other.
					<br>
					<br>
					During the trip, the group also does a lot of activities together, such as having drinks together, attend a show, and doing a â€˜scavenger huntâ€™-like game. Because there are at most 30 participants, the group usually gets close very soon. To
					encourage this, there is already a get-to-know evening before the trip, to make sure that everyone knows each other before they leave.
					<br>
					<br>
					As a token of remembrance, everyone gets a commemorative book at the end of the trip. Before, during, and after the trip, some people will make small articles on what we did on different days, the country itself, the group, and the cases.
					These are combined with pictures of the trip into an actual book(let).
