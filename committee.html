        </header>

        <p>The Study Tour Committee organizes the biannual professional study tour of Intermate. Of course, this requires a strong multidisciplinary team. At the end of May (2019), Study Tour Intermate 2021 was formed. Enough members were collected to start planning the trip. But first things first, a role division needed to be made to have the process of planning run smoothly. On this page we will introduce you to all the essential roles of the different committee members.</p>

        <h3>Chairperson</h3>

The chairperson is responsible for the overall organization of the committee, the trip and leading everything into the right direction. This year’s chairperson is <b>Annebelle Olminkhof</b>. She really represents the committee as its figurehead. She will be leading our meetings, making sure the meetings are planned effectively and dealt with in an efficient manner. She will keep an eye on the overall planning and provide support where needed.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Treasurer</h3>
Our treasurer, <b>Esther Mendel</b>, makes sure all funds and spendings are accounted for. She is the safeguard of the committee’s finances. Since such a big trip requires a lot of money, the treasurer makes sure the tour is financially possible. She keeps an eye on the general financial oversight and makes sure financial responsibilities are met. In general the treasurer is responsible for funding, budgeting, financial reporting and bookkeeping.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Head of Public Relations</h3>
The head of public relations (PR) is responsible for promoting the study trip. Our PR, <b>Latisha Boor</b>, ensures a representative image of the study trip by providing promotional material, such as folders and brochures. The PR develops and manages media contacts, puts together well-written communications (such as Intermania articles) and creates a web presence that attracts attention.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Head of External Affairs</h3>
This year’s head of external affairs is <b>Trijntje Willems</b>. She is responsible for recruiting companies for case studies and sponsoring. By setting up calling sheets with interesting companies Trijntje made sure that contacting companies happened in a structured and efficient manner.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Head of Program</h3>
It is the responsibility of <b>Ahmed Gamal</b> to arrange everything about the program, travels and accommodations during the trip. The head of program makes sure to investigate the destination culturally in order to make sure we have the full Scandinavian experience! In general the head of program is responsible for making contacts in Scandinavia, such as calling the companies and accommodations abroad.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Board Responsible</h3>
Our board responsible, <b>Meie Kleijburg</b>, takes part in tasks of the above mentioned roles. She is the first to support the other committee members if needed. She also participates in the organizational tasks. The board responsible has unique experiences and contacts that are rarer for the other committee members to have. Therefore the board responsible can often give great advice. In the end the board responsible makes sure the progress of the committee is shared with the Intermate board as well.
